  <section class=page-section>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how My TODO App ("the Application") handles your information. Your privacy is
      critically important to us.</p>
  </section>

  <section class=page-section>
    <h2>1. Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p>My TODO App is designed with your privacy in mind. We want to be absolutely clear: <strong>we do not collect,
      store, transmit, or process any personal data or task information on our servers.</strong></p>
    <p>All of your tasks and any preferences you set within the application are stored exclusively in your browser's
      Local Storage. This means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your data never leaves your device.</li>
      <li>We have no access to your tasks, ever.</li>
      <li>There is no user registration, login, or database on our end.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The benefit of this approach is maximum privacy for you. The implication is that if you clear your browser's
      data, use a different web browser, or switch to a different device, your tasks will not be synchronized and will
      appear empty on the new browser/device.</p>
  </section>

  <section class=page-section>
    <h2>2. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <p>My TODO App does not use cookies for tracking or any other purpose. As we do not collect or transmit user data,
      there is no need for such tracking technologies.</p>
  </section>

  <section class=page-section>
    <h2>3. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by My TODO App. While our application may contain
      links to other websites (e.g., social media links on the contact page), we are not responsible for the privacy
      practices of those other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the
      privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.</p>
  </section>

  <section class=page-section>
    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>My TODO App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information
      from children under 13.</p>
  </section>

  <section class=page-section>
    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy
      Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this
      Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
  </section>
